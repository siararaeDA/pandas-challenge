Write Up of Observable Trends:

The first trend I noticed was one that surprised me. In the table where we compare test scores and passing percentages to the spending ranges per students, it looks like in the district the data is from, the more money spent for student, the lower the grades and passing percentages are. I would have thought the opposite, that the schools who spent more money on their students had higher average test scores and higher passing percentages. It seems like they aren’t using their money effectively, based on that data.

The other trend that was very noticeable was in the tables that sorted the Top Performing Schools by Overall Passing Percentage and the Bottom Performing Schools by Passing Percentage. All of the top performing schools are charter schools, and all of the bottom performing schools are district schools. I don’t have a high level of knowledge about charter schools, but it seems like the charter schools would be privately funded and a quick google search says they can design their classrooms as they would like to meet their students’ needs. It appears this strategy is working, because their overall passing percentage is much higher than the publicly funded district schools.
